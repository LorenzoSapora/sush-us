With over 9000 nanoseconds of awesome, this little bit of awesome has started my day off with a smile. Made by Friskies and found on Hexingtons blog (twice), this makes me want to do this to my cat but I know his lazy ass doesn't move from the second I leave to the moment I open the cat food.. ~sigh. I hope this video gives you a great start to your day.
(If not, why not, you heartless bum).
