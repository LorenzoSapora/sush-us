Twitter has a problem with Trump, and they're not afraid to shout into the void.

I started muting everyone that replied to Donald's tweets. This was not very eligant.

- Block all accounts that reply to a tweet
- Block accounts, whilst whitelisting people you follow
- Block accounts that just post an image
- Block accounts
