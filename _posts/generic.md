## Magento

I’m a Magento developer currently working on the official Magento iOS app redesign. I’ve designed and developed a large amount of Magento sites over the past 5 years. The multistore setup is my speciality. I’ve written two extensions for Magentoconnect and have a strong working knowledge of everything Magento.

A little bit of background on myself: I have been working as a graphic designer and developer for nearly 9 years. Working with big companies like Formula one, Clarks, Red Bull and charities such as eden valley hospice and macmillan cancer support. I would be happy to work on this job with you.

Is there anything you wish to ask me? Technical or personal/professionally?
